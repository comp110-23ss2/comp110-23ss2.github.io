<h1>In-Class Support</h1>
<p>In-Class Support for async days will be provided on <a href="https://campuswire.com/p/GD77C6F5C">Campus Wire</a>. The course code is 5985. <strong>Use your UNC email to sign up or you will be removed from the site!</strong></p>

<h1>Office Hours</h1>
<p>Come drop-in for one-on-one support in office hours with a member of the <a href="/resources/team.html">COMP110 team</a>. We are open for 24 hours per week. Except for on due dates, the average wait time is less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Office hours is the ideal place to come for one-on-one help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercises</li>
<li>Conceptual Questions</li>
<li>Lessons</li>
<li>Challenge Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical office hours are listed to the right, but check Course.Care for the most up-to-date availability this week.</p>
<p>Note: We must stop taking tickets at the closing time and cannot stay beyond. If the queue is long enough that we do not believe we will be able to see all tickets we will turn off the ability to submit new tickets before closing time.</p>
<p>Office hours appointments for programming exercises are limited to 15 minutes and <strong>one specific question</strong> per appointment in order to be as fair as possible to all students enrolled. For longer, conceptual help outside of specific projects we encourage coming to office hours for conceptual help on non-deadline days.</p>
<p>In order to serve every student in the course as best we can, we must enforce a 1-hour wait period between appointments with the same student. During this time, we expect you to continue making substantive progress on your programming exercise. If you anticipate needing significant amounts of help on an assignment, please start as far in advance as possible so you will have multiple opportunities to ask questions as they arise. Realizing you need help more than once in a given day is an indication you would benefit from a stronger conceptual understanding of the material in question and it would be great for you to come work with us during tutoring hours!</p>
<p>To work with us in office hours, <a href="https://course.care/register-details?enrollCode=485DD0" target="_blank">register for Course.Care via this link</a> or register with enroll code 485DD0.</p>

<h1>Tutoring</h1>
<p><a href="https://course.care" target="_blank">Come to tutoring hours for conceptual help</a> with members of the COMP110 UTA team and small groups of your peers. You can find these locations and links on <a href="https://course.care" target="_blank">Course.Care</a>, just like office hours. If you are feeling a little behind or like you could use some extra practice tutoring is for you! Tutoring does not have time constraints outside of the hours it is open for.</p>
<p>Tutoring is a great opportunity to find help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual Questions</li>
<li>Lecture Review</li>
<li>Practice</li>
</ul>

<h1>E-mail Heads Address</h1>
<p>If you have an emergency, such as a hospitalization or severe illness, please reach out to Alyssa and head UTAs via: <a href="mailto:comp110help@gmail.com" class="email">comp110help@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>In general, we cannot help with programming or assignment questions via e-mail and you should come see us in office hours for questions on assignments. Over the years we have learned is too difficult, time consuming, and frustrating for you and for us to try and resolve technical issues via screenshots e-mailed back and forth. Thus, we will redirect any such emails to office hours (described above) and cannot help with technical issues over e-mail.</p>
